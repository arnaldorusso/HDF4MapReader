h4mapwriter is a utility that creates an HDF4 file content map for a given HDF4 file. An HDF4 file content map is an XML document that describes the file structure, file metadata, and offset/length of raw data in a HDF4 file. The map can be used to retrieve data from an HDF4 file without relying on the HDF4 library.
